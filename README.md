# Image-Processing-Toolbox
Developing Computer Vision applications are difficult. One should consider the capabilities of the framework, on the other hand how this framework will react and perform on given test data. In other case, one may want to see only effect of the consecutive image processing functions on test data. In both and many cases, small toolboxes of the frameworks help people to see results easily, fast and enable them to fast prototyping. Hence this toolbox is created for Computer Vision application developers and enthusiast who want to see image processing functions on their images with very basic knowledge. It's developed with minimal design, which makes it easy to use. However it is also powerful toolbox due to its support of parameters.
